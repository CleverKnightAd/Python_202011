#We are going to learn how to convert ints and floats into strings.
#Thees and examples of ints and floats into strings.

#First ints into strings.

a = 1
b = str(a)
print(b)

print("b is a string " + b)

print("b is a string " + a)

#Now that b holds the value of a as a string, you can not use it in a calcuation.

z = 3+b
print(z)

x = 3+a
print(x)

#Now let's do floats into strings.

e = 1.2
f = str(e)
print(f)

#Let's make sure that it is a string.

i = 4+f
print(i)

j = 5+e
print(j)
